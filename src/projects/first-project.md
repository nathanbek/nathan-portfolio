### Task

Provide a platform to visualize and access the vast amounts of data collected by various institutions on Antarctic research. The goal is to enhance data accessibility and usability, making it easier for researchers and the public to explore and understand the available data. The project will employ modern web technologies and data visualization techniques to create an interactive and user-friendly website.

### Solution

Develop an interactive website that aggregates data from different institutions, providing a comprehensive view of Antarctic research. The site will include features such as data availability maps, institution-specific layers, and comparative analysis tools. By leveraging Bootstrap for responsive design and deploying on Netlify for easy updates, the site will ensure seamless access to data. Real-time data updates and user-generated content will enhance the site's relevance and usability.
